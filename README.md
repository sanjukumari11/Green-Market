# Green-Market
This project focuses on the analysis of daily wholesale commodity prices from various agricultural markets (mandis) across India. The dataset contains detailed records of prices for a wide range of commodities, along with information about their state, district, market, variety, grade, and date of arrival.

The main objectives of this project are:

To clean and preprocess the raw data for consistency and usability.

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies in commodity prices.

To provide summary statistics for minimum, maximum, and modal prices of each commodity.

To enable further visualization and modeling for price forecasting, regional comparison, or market insights.

By leveraging Python and popular data science libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), this project offers a foundation for understanding the dynamics of agricultural commodity pricing in India, supporting both research and informed decision-making.
